**Steps**


```
create a project folder
mkdir HELLO-WORLD-API
cd HELLO-WORLD-API
npm init -y ( to initialize the project)
npm install express.js
create a API-caller.js file for API
To run the following code in API-caller.js file run "node API-caller.js"
> server running on port 5000
create  index.html  and index.js file in same folder
run frontend on  web-page using live-server

```
```

Problem can be faced during frontend connecting to express server 

TO resolve that install cors library
npm install cors
after running the file API-caller.js 
and on http://localhost:5000/hello?language=English the desire output is achieved 

for Testing the API locally Postman is used

```
